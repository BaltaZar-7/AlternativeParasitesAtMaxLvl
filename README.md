# Alternative Parasites At Max Lvl
This mod reintroduces Intestinal Parasites at Cooking level 5, with alternative, less harsh impact. Only impacts characters with cooking level 5.  
# Description
This mod is adding the Intestinal Parasites RISK to the player after reaching cooking level 5. There are two settings:  
- Incremental mode: same as vanilla below cooking level 5, but only with 1% chance per eating  
- Fixed mode: After you eat once, 1% chance, but you can eat any amount after that, it stays on 1%  
There is also a new QOL feature, which is a notification that another dose of medication can be taken for the real Intestinal Parasites (not the risk). In other words the 24 hours timer elapsed. This reminder can be turned off via ModSettings.
